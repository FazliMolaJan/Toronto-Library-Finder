# Toronto-Library-Finder
Toronto Libraries is an app that allows the users of the app to browse a list of all the public libraries located in the City of Toronto.  This application will use the GIS data that is provided by the City of Toronto, which contains the Name, address, hours of operation, phone number, etc.  The main screen will provide the users with a list of all the library names in a scrollable view.  The user can then choose one library which would open another screen which would provide the user with the address of the library, phone number and also the Hours of operation of that selected library.  There will also be a search button which will allow the user to narrow down the results.
## Use-Cases:
User opens the app →  The system opens the app and provides the user with a list of all the libraries located in the City of Toronto.

User selects a specific library from the list → The system opens a new activity which would display the Address, Phone Number, and the Hours of Operation of the selected library.

User Selects the back button →  The system will take the user back to the list of the libraries and then the user is free to choose any other library branch.
